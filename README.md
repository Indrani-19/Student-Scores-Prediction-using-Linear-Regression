# Student Scores Prediction using Linear Regression

This project uses **Supervised Machine Learning** to predict student scores based on the number of hours they studied. The goal is to build a **Linear Regression model** that can accurately predict scores given the study hours.

## Introduction

The dataset contains two columns:
- **Hours**: The number of hours a student studied.
- **Scores**: The score achieved by the student.

Using **Linear Regression**, a supervised learning algorithm, we predict the scores of students based on the number of hours they studied. This project demonstrates the end-to-end process of data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is included in the repository (`data/student_scores.csv`). It contains the following columns:
- **Hours**: Number of hours studied (independent variable).
- **Scores**: Score achieved by the student (dependent variable).

## Features

- Implementation of **Linear Regression** from scratch.
- Data preprocessing and visualization.
- Model training and evaluation.
- Prediction of student scores based on study hours.
